# neogate

## Neogate is highly experimental and still changes frequently without notice. Old versions will also not be supported. Please wait for a proper release to use it in your projects, if you even want to.

Neogate is Liphium's WebSocket gateway implementation. Feel free to peak around and see how all of Liphium's real-time pipeline works. It's separated out to make it reusable in other projects or smaller services we might add to this repository in the future. Who knows what might happen?

The adapter pattern found in this module is something that makes it really easy to develop real-time systems no matter how complex. Everything can be modelled using them and that's also a reason why I maybe want to reuse it in future projects since it's already been tested well here in Liphium.
